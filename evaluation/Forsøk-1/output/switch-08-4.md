## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Device Role
- **Device Role**: ~ INFERRED - **Access Layer Switch**
  - Justification: The device has many access ports (10), no routing enabled, and is connected to end-user devices (PCs and servers). It also has a trunk port to a likely distribution switch (`FastEthernet0/24`), which is typical for an access layer switch.

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- **Syslog logging is enabled** and configured to send logs to 10.99.0.50 ✓ VERIFIED
- **NTP is enabled** with a configured server (10.99.0.1) ✓ VERIFIED
- **PortFast is enabled** on all access ports, reducing STP convergence time ✓ VERIFIED
- **No password encryption** is used, which is a known security risk, but this is a lab environment and may be intentional ? UNCERTAIN
- **Banner is configured** to warn users this is a lab environment: `banner motd ^CLab-miljoe. Ingen produksjonsdata tillatt.^C` ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **SSH is not configured**, and VTY lines allow both SSH and Telnet. Telnet is insecure and should be disabled. ? UNCERTAIN
- **VTY lines have no authentication** and no access control (no ACL). This is a significant security gap. ✓ VERIFIED
- **AAA is not enabled**, so there is no centralized authentication, authorization, or accounting. ✓ VERIFIED
- **DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection are not enabled**, leaving the network vulnerable to spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. ✓ VERIFIED
- **Port security is not enabled** on any interface, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect. ✓ VERIFIED
- **No SNMP configuration** is present, which may be intentional for a lab device, but it limits monitoring capabilities. ✓ VERIFIED

#### Recommendations
- **Enable SSH** and disable Telnet on VTY lines to secure remote access.
- **Implement AAA** for centralized authentication and authorization.
- **Enable DHCP Snooping** and **Dynamic ARP Inspection** on VLANs 110 and 120 to improve security.
- **Enable port security** on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.
- **Apply access control lists (ACLs)** to VTY lines to restrict access to trusted IP addresses.
- **Enable IP Source Guard** to prevent IP spoofing.
- **Consider enabling SNMP** if monitoring is required, and configure it securely.
- **Enable password encryption** using `service password-encryption` to protect clear-text passwords.

## Summary

lab-sw01 is an **Access Layer Switch** in a lab environment, providing connectivity to PCs and servers in VLANs 110 and 120. It has a management VLAN (VLAN 99) with an assigned IP address and is connected to a distribution switch via a trunk port. The configuration is minimal and lacks several security features that would be expected in a production environment. While it is suitable for a lab setting, it would require significant hardening before deployment in a production network.
