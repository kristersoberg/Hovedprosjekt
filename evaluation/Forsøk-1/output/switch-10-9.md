## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- **SSH-only VTY access** with timeout and authentication ✓ VERIFIED
- **AAA with TACACS+ integration** for authentication, authorization, and accounting ✓ VERIFIED
- **Port security** enabled on 8 access ports ✓ VERIFIED
- **DHCP snooping** and **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** enabled on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ✓ VERIFIED
- **CDP is disabled**, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED
- **Management access restricted** via ACL `MGMT-ACCESS` ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **802.1X** is not configured, leaving wired access vulnerable to unauthorized device access ? UNCERTAIN
- **IP Source Guard** is not configured, which could help prevent IP spoofing ? UNCERTAIN
- **LLDP** is not enabled, which could be used for network discovery and monitoring ? UNCERTAIN
- **No password complexity policy** is enforced for local users ? UNCERTAIN
- **No rate limiting** on SSH or login attempts is configured ? UNCERTAIN
- **No secure erase** of old configurations or logs is mentioned ? UNCERTAIN

#### Recommendations
- Enable **802.1X** for wired access control to enforce device authentication.
- Consider enabling **IP Source Guard** to prevent IP spoofing.
- Enable **LLDP** for network discovery and monitoring.
- Implement **password complexity policies** for local users.
- Add **rate limiting** on SSH and login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Ensure **secure erase** of old configurations and logs is part of the maintenance process.
- Consider enabling **portfast bpduguard** on all access ports to prevent STP loops.

## Summary

This device, **aksess-sw10**, is an **Access Layer switch** based on its configuration. It provides wired access to multiple VLANs (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) and connects to a distribution switch via a trunk EtherChannel. It has strong security features including AAA with TACACS+, port security, DHCP snooping, and DAI. The configuration is well-structured and includes logging, NTP, and SNMP for monitoring and management. The device is configured to support VoIP and has a clear separation between management and user VLANs.

~ INFERRED: The device appears to be part of a larger campus network, likely in a multi-story office building, with VLANs per floor and a centralized management VLAN.
