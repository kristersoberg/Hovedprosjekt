## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only VTY access with version 2 and timeout of 60 seconds ✓ VERIFIED
- AAA authentication and authorization using TACACS+ with fallback to local users ✓ VERIFIED
- DHCP snooping and DAI enabled on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ✓ VERIFIED
- Port security configured on 8 access ports ✓ VERIFIED
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED
- Logging is enabled with two syslog servers and source interface specified ✓ VERIFIED
- NTP is configured with authentication, ensuring time integrity ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- 802.1X is not configured, which could enhance endpoint authentication on access ports ? UNCERTAIN
- IP Source Guard is not configured, which could prevent IP spoofing ? UNCERTAIN
- SNMP is using version 2c, which is less secure than SNMPv3 ? UNCERTAIN
- No rate limiting or ACLs on the management interface beyond MGMT-ACCESS ? UNCERTAIN
- No explicit mitigation for VLAN hopping (e.g., disabling unused VLANs) ? UNCERTAIN

#### Recommendations
- Consider enabling 802.1X on access ports for stronger endpoint authentication ~ INFERRED
- Implement IP Source Guard on VLANs with DHCP snooping to prevent IP spoofing ~ INFERRED
- Upgrade SNMP to version 3 for stronger security ~ INFERRED
- Add rate limiting or ACLs to further restrict access to the management interface ~ INFERRED
- Review and disable unused VLANs to prevent VLAN hopping ~ INFERRED

## Summary

This device, aksess-sw10, is an **Access Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes numerous access ports with port security, no routing enabled, and VLANs primarily used for end-user access. The configuration is well-structured and includes strong security features such as AAA with TACACS+, SSH-only access, DHCP snooping, and DAI. The device is configured with a management VLAN and IP, and logging is enabled to two syslog servers. The configuration is of high quality and aligns with best practices for an access-layer switch in a secure enterprise environment.
