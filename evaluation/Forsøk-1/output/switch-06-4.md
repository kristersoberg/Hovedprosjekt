## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Device Role
- **Device Role**: ~ INFERRED
  - This device is an **Access Layer Switch**.
  - Justification: It has multiple access ports with port security, 802.1X authentication, and no routing enabled. It connects end-user devices and uplinks to a distribution switch.

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is configured with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.
- 802.1X authentication is enabled on access ports, providing strong user and device authentication.
- DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, preventing rogue DHCP servers.
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, mitigating ARP spoofing attacks.
- Port security is enabled on 4 access ports, limiting the number of MAC addresses per port.
- CDP is disabled, reducing the risk of lateral discovery and attacks.
- AAA is enabled with RADIUS authentication, ensuring centralized user authentication.
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management interface, restricting access to trusted subnets.
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **NTP is not configured**, which could lead to time synchronization issues and affect log correlation.
- **SNMP is not configured**, which limits monitoring and management capabilities.
- **LLDP is not enabled**, which could be useful for network discovery and documentation.
- **IP Source Guard is not configured**, which could help prevent IP spoofing on VLANs with DHCP snooping.
- **VLAN 1 is not removed** (still exists and is shutdown), which is a best practice to avoid VLAN 1 being used for management or user traffic.
- **No password complexity policy** is enforced for local users.
- **No rate limiting** is configured for SSH or console access.
- **No logging to a remote syslog server** is configured beyond the single server (10.99.0.50).

#### Recommendations
- Enable and configure **NTP** with at least one NTP server to ensure accurate timekeeping.
- Enable **SNMP** with appropriate community strings and access control to improve monitoring.
- Enable **LLDP** to assist with network discovery and documentation.
- Enable **IP Source Guard** on VLANs 10 and 20 to prevent IP spoofing.
- Remove **VLAN 1** entirely using the `no vlan 1` command to prevent its use.
- Implement **password complexity policies** for local users to enforce strong passwords.
- Consider implementing **rate limiting** on SSH and console access to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Add **additional logging destinations** to ensure redundancy in case the primary syslog server is unavailable.

## Summary
The device `switch-06` is an **Access Layer Switch** configured with strong security features such as 802.1X, DHCP snooping, and port security. It connects end-user devices and uplinks to a distribution switch. The configuration is well-structured and follows best practices for access layer security. However, there are several areas for improvement, including NTP and SNMP configuration, and the removal of unused VLANs.

~ INFERRED: The device appears to be part of a secure enterprise network with centralized authentication via RADIUS and strong access control policies.
