## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only VTY access with version 2 and 60-second timeout ✓ VERIFIED  
- AAA authentication and authorization enabled with local user authentication ✓ VERIFIED  
- DHCP snooping enabled globally ✓ VERIFIED  
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED  
- Access control lists (ACLs) are configured for management and internal traffic filtering ✓ VERIFIED  
- Syslog is enabled with remote logging to 10.99.0.50 ✓ VERIFIED  
- NTP is configured for time synchronization ✓ VERIFIED  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- DHCP snooping is enabled but no specific VLANs are specified for snooping – this could leave some VLANs unprotected ? UNCERTAIN  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled – recommended for VLANs with DHCP snooping ✓ VERIFIED  
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces – could be beneficial for access ports ? UNCERTAIN  
- No SNMP configuration – could be a gap for monitoring ? UNCERTAIN  
- No 802.1X or IP Source Guard – could improve security on access ports ? UNCERTAIN  

#### Recommendations
- Specify VLANs for DHCP snooping to ensure all relevant VLANs are protected  
- Enable DAI on VLANs with DHCP snooping to prevent ARP spoofing  
- Consider enabling port security on access ports if access layer devices are connected  
- Implement SNMP for monitoring and management  
- Enable 802.1X and IP Source Guard on access ports for enhanced security  
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting

## Summary

dis-sw02 is a **Distribution Layer** switch operating in a multi-VLAN environment with inter-VLAN routing enabled. It serves as a gateway for VLANs 10, 20, 30, 50, and 99, and connects to both core and access layer switches. The configuration is well-structured and includes several security best practices such as SSH, AAA, and ACLs. However, there are opportunities to enhance security further by enabling additional features like DAI and port security.
