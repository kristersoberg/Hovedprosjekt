## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication for console and VTY access.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, helping prevent rogue DHCP servers.  
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential attack vectors.  
- Access control lists (ACLs) are configured for management and guest traffic control.  
- Syslog is enabled with a remote server, aiding in monitoring and auditing.  
- NTP is configured for time synchronization, which is essential for log correlation.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing.  
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.  
- 802.1X is not configured, which could leave the network open to unauthorized access.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses.  
- VLAN 666 is used as the native VLAN on trunk ports, which is a security risk if not properly secured.  
- No SNMP configuration is present, which could hinder network monitoring and management.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs where it is needed.  
- Implement port security on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.  
- Consider enabling 802.1X for secure user and device authentication.  
- Enable IP Source Guard to prevent IP address spoofing.  
- Change the native VLAN on trunk ports to a non-routed VLAN (e.g., VLAN 999) to reduce security risks.  
- Configure SNMP with appropriate community strings and access controls.  
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and monitoring.

## Summary

The device `dis-sw01` is a **Distribution Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is running Cisco IOS version 15.2(2)E9 and is configured with a strong baseline of security features such as SSH, AAA, and DHCP snooping. However, there are several areas for improvement, particularly in the areas of ARP spoofing protection, port security, and 802.1X authentication. The configuration is well-structured and includes comprehensive logging and NTP support, which are essential for operational visibility and compliance.
