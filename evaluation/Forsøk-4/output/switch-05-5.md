## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication and authorization, providing a basic level of access control.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, helping prevent rogue DHCP servers.  
- CDP is disabled, reducing the risk of network discovery attacks.  
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management VLAN to restrict access.  
- An extended ACL (`BLOCK-GUEST-INTERNAL`) is configured to block internal traffic from the guest VLAN to other VLANs.  
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- DHCP snooping is enabled but not scoped to specific VLANs, which could reduce its effectiveness.  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled, leaving the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses to bypass ACLs.  
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.  
- 802.1X is not configured, which could allow unauthenticated devices to access the network.  
- SNMP is not configured, which could limit monitoring and management capabilities.  
- No routing protocol is configured, which may limit scalability and redundancy in the routing domain.  

#### Recommendations
- Scope DHCP snooping to specific VLANs (e.g., `ip dhcp snooping vlan 10,20,30,50,99`) to improve security.  
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs where it is needed.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Consider enabling port security on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.  
- Implement 802.1X authentication for wired and wireless access.  
- Configure SNMP with secure community strings and access controls.  
- Consider implementing a routing protocol (e.g., EIGRP or OSPF) to improve routing scalability and redundancy.

## Summary

dis-sw02 is a **Distribution Layer** switch, as evidenced by the presence of multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. The device is configured with a strong foundation for security, including SSH, AAA, and ACLs, but lacks some advanced features like DAI and port security. The configuration is well-structured and appears to be in good operational condition, with a clear separation of VLANs and a focus on management and security.
