## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only access is enforced for remote management (`transport input ssh`) ✓ VERIFIED  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication and authorization ✓ VERIFIED  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, with trust configured on uplink interfaces ✓ VERIFIED  
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED  
- VLAN interfaces are secured with HSRP and access control (e.g., VLAN 99 with `MGMT-ACCESS` ACL) ✓ VERIFIED  
- Guest VLAN (VLAN 20) is isolated from internal VLANs using extended ACL `BLOCK-GUEST-INTERNAL` ✓ VERIFIED  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- DHCP snooping is enabled but no specific VLANs are specified – this could lead to inconsistent enforcement ? UNCERTAIN  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled – could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing ⚠ INFERRED  
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces – could allow unauthorized device access ⚠ INFERRED  
- No SNMP configuration is present – could hinder monitoring and management ⚠ INFERRED  
- No 802.1X or IP Source Guard is configured – could allow rogue devices to connect ⚠ INFERRED  

#### Recommendations
- Specify VLANs for DHCP snooping to ensure consistent enforcement (e.g., `ip dhcp snooping vlan 10,20,30,50,99`) ~ INFERRED  
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs with user access (e.g., VLAN 10, 20, 30) ~ INFERRED  
- Enable port security on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access ~ INFERRED  
- Implement SNMP with secure community strings and access control for monitoring ~ INFERRED  
- Consider enabling 802.1X for secure user authentication on access ports ~ INFERRED  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs with user access to prevent IP spoofing ~ INFERRED

## Summary

dis-sw01 is a **Distribution Layer** switch, as evidenced by the presence of multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. The device is configured with strong remote access controls (SSH-only VTY access), AAA authentication, and basic security features like DHCP snooping and VLAN isolation. However, there are opportunities to enhance security by enabling additional features such as DAI, port security, and 802.1X. The configuration is well-structured and appears to be in good operational condition.
