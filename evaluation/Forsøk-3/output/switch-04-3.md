## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only VTY access with version 2 and 60-second timeout ✓ VERIFIED  
- Console access secured with local authentication and synchronous logging ✓ VERIFIED  
- DHCP snooping enabled globally ✓ VERIFIED  
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED  
- VLAN interfaces (SVIs) have HSRP configured for redundancy ✓ VERIFIED  
- Access control lists (ACLs) are in place for management and internal traffic filtering ✓ VERIFIED  
- Syslog is configured to send logs to a remote server (10.99.0.50) ✓ VERIFIED  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- DHCP snooping is enabled but no specific VLANs are specified for snooping – this could leave some VLANs unprotected ? UNCERTAIN  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled – recommended for VLANs with dynamic IP assignment ? UNCERTAIN  
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces – could be beneficial for access ports ? UNCERTAIN  
- No SNMP configuration – could be a gap in monitoring and management ? UNCERTAIN  
- No 802.1X authentication – if this switch connects to user devices, 802.1X could enhance security ? UNCERTAIN  

#### Recommendations
- Specify VLANs for DHCP snooping to ensure all relevant VLANs are protected  
- Enable DAI on VLANs where it is needed (e.g., VLAN 10, 20, 30, 50)  
- Consider enabling port security on access ports if they are used for end-user devices  
- Implement SNMP for monitoring and management  
- Consider enabling 802.1X if this switch connects to user devices  
- Review and tighten ACLs to ensure they are as restrictive as possible  
- Ensure all VLANs have appropriate STP priorities and root bridge placements for redundancy

## Summary

The device `dis-sw01` is a **Distribution Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is running Cisco IOS version 15.2(2)E9 and is part of the `core.bedrift.no` domain. The configuration is well-structured and includes several security best practices such as SSH-only access, DHCP snooping, and access control lists. However, there are opportunities to enhance security further, particularly with DAI and port security. The device is configured for redundancy using HSRP and rapid-pvst STP.
