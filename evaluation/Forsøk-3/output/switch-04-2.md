## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication for console and VTY access.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, helping prevent rogue DHCP servers.  
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack surface.  
- Access control lists (`MGMT-ACCESS`, `BLOCK-GUEST-INTERNAL`) are configured to restrict traffic.  
- Management VLAN is isolated and protected with an ACL.  
- Port security is not enabled, but this is not a concern as no access ports are configured.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing.  
- 802.1X is not configured, which could be a concern if the switch is connected to untrusted endpoints.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses.  
- VLAN 666 is used as the native VLAN on trunk ports, which is a security risk if not properly secured.  
- No SNMP configuration is present, which may impact monitoring and management capabilities.  
- No VTP configuration is present, which may be intentional but should be documented.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs where it is needed.  
- Consider enabling 802.1X on access ports if the switch is connected to untrusted endpoints.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs where it is needed.  
- Change the native VLAN on trunk ports to a non-routed VLAN (e.g., VLAN 99) to reduce security risks.  
- Implement SNMP with secure community strings and access control.  
- Document the absence of VTP configuration and ensure it is intentional.  
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and monitoring.

## Summary

The device `dis-sw01` is a **Distribution Layer switch** (~ INFERRED) based on its configuration of multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is configured with a strong baseline of security features, including SSH, AAA, and DHCP snooping. However, there are several areas for improvement, particularly in the areas of ARP spoofing protection and native VLAN security. The configuration is well-structured and appears to be in good operational condition.
