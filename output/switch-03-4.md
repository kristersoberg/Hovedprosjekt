## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, providing secure remote access.  
- Port security is enabled on 6 access ports, limiting unauthorized device access.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANs 10, 20, and 30, preventing rogue DHCP servers.  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is enabled on the same VLANs, mitigating ARP spoofing.  
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential attack vectors.  
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management VLAN to restrict access.  
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- AAA is not enabled, which means there is no centralized authentication, authorization, or accounting.  
- No 802.1X is configured, which could enhance endpoint security.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could help prevent IP spoofing.  
- SNMP is not configured, which may impact monitoring and management capabilities.  
- No password is configured for the VTY lines, which could allow unauthorized access if SSH is bypassed.  
- No password is configured for the console line, which could allow physical access to be exploited.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable AAA with local or remote authentication to enforce user authentication and authorization.  
- Implement 802.1X for secure endpoint authentication.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs 10, 20, and 30 to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Configure SNMP with appropriate community strings and access controls for monitoring.  
- Set passwords for the `line vty 0 4` and `line con 0` to enforce authentication for console and VTY access.  
- Consider enabling logging to a remote syslog server for centralized log management.  
- Review and tighten the `MGMT-ACCESS` ACL to ensure it only allows necessary IP ranges.  

## Summary

switch-03 is an **Access Layer** switch, as evidenced by the large number of access ports, port security configurations, and lack of routing. It serves as a local access point for end devices in VLANs 10 (Ansatte), 20 (Gjest), and 30 (Skrivere), with a dedicated management VLAN (99). The device has strong foundational security features such as SSH, port security, DHCP snooping, and DAI, but lacks advanced security mechanisms like AAA and 802.1X. The configuration is well-structured and includes essential network services like NTP and syslog.  

**Device Role**: Access Layer Switch ~ INFERRED
