## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication for both console and VTY lines.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, which helps prevent rogue DHCP servers.  
- CDP is disabled, reducing the risk of lateral discovery.  
- Access control lists (`MGMT-ACCESS` and `BLOCK-GUEST-INTERNAL`) are configured to restrict access and prevent internal guest traffic from reaching other VLANs.  
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing.  
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses to bypass ACLs.  
- 802.1X is not configured, which could allow unauthenticated devices to access the network.  
- VLAN 666 is referenced in trunk configurations but is not defined in the VLAN configuration section. This may be a misconfiguration or an oversight.  
- No routing protocols are configured, which may limit scalability and redundancy in the routing domain.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs where it is needed.  
- Enable port security on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.  
- Enable IP Source Guard to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Consider implementing 802.1X for secure device authentication.  
- Define VLAN 666 if it is intended to be used, or remove it from trunk configurations if it is not.  
- Consider implementing routing protocols (e.g., EIGRP or OSPF) to improve routing scalability and redundancy.  
- Ensure that all VLANs with SVIs have appropriate ACLs and security policies applied.

## Summary

The device `dis-sw01` is a **Distribution Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is configured with a strong baseline of security features, including SSH, AAA, and access control lists. However, there are several areas for improvement, particularly in the areas of dynamic ARP inspection, port security, and 802.1X authentication. The configuration is well-structured and appears to be in good operational condition, but additional security hardening is recommended to fully secure the device and network.
