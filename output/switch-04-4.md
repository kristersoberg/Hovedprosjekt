## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication for both console and VTY lines.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, helping prevent rogue DHCP servers.  
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential attack vectors.  
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to VTY lines, restricting management access.  
- An extended ACL (`BLOCK-GUEST-INTERNAL`) is configured to block internal traffic from the guest VLAN.  
- Syslog is enabled with a remote server, providing centralized logging.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- DHCP snooping is enabled but no specific VLANs are configured for snooping. This could leave some VLANs vulnerable to rogue DHCP servers.  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled, which could allow ARP spoofing attacks.  
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses to bypass ACLs.  
- 802.1X is not configured, which could allow unauthorized devices to access the network.  
- SNMP is not configured, which could limit monitoring and management capabilities.  
- No VLANs are configured for voice or guest traffic with specific security policies.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable DHCP snooping on specific VLANs (e.g., VLAN 10, 20, 30, 50, 99) to ensure only trusted ports can provide DHCP services.
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs where it is needed to prevent ARP spoofing.
- Enable port security on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs to prevent IP spoofing.
- Consider implementing 802.1X for secure device authentication.
- Configure SNMP with appropriate community strings and access controls for monitoring.
- Review and refine the `BLOCK-GUEST-INTERNAL` ACL to ensure it is effective and not overly restrictive.
- Ensure all VLANs have appropriate security policies and access controls.

## Summary

The device `dis-sw01` is a **Distribution Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is configured with a strong foundation of security features such as SSH, AAA, and ACLs, but lacks some advanced protections like DAI, port security, and 802.1X. The configuration is well-structured and includes essential network services such as NTP, syslog, and routing. With a few additional security enhancements, this device could provide a robust and secure distribution layer in the network.
