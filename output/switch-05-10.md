## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, providing secure remote access.
- AAA is enabled with local authentication and authorization, ensuring user accountability.
- DHCP snooping is enabled, helping prevent rogue DHCP servers.
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack vectors.
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management VLAN to restrict access.
- An extended ACL (`BLOCK-GUEST-INTERNAL`) is configured to prevent internal traffic from the guest VLAN to other VLANs.
- Logging is enabled with a remote syslog server, aiding in auditing and troubleshooting.
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **DHCP Snooping VLANs**: DHCP snooping is enabled globally but not explicitly configured on specific VLANs. It is recommended to specify VLANs to ensure proper enforcement.
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**: Not enabled. DAI should be configured to prevent ARP spoofing attacks.
- **Port Security**: Not enabled on any interfaces. Port security should be implemented on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.
- **IP Source Guard**: Not enabled. IP Source Guard should be configured to prevent IP spoofing.
- **802.1X**: Not configured. 802.1X should be implemented for secure port-based authentication.
- **LLDP**: Not enabled. LLDP could be used for network discovery and device identification.
- **SNMP**: Not configured. SNMP should be configured for monitoring and management.
- **NTP Authentication**: NTP is configured without authentication. NTP authentication should be enabled to prevent time spoofing.

#### Recommendations
- Enable **DHCP snooping on specific VLANs** (e.g., VLAN 10, 20, 30, 50, 99).
- Enable **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** on VLANs with DHCP snooping.
- Enable **IP Source Guard** on VLANs with DHCP snooping.
- Implement **802.1X** on access ports for secure authentication.
- Enable **LLDP** for network discovery and device identification.
- Configure **SNMP** for monitoring and management.
- Enable **NTP authentication** to secure time synchronization.
- Consider enabling **port security** on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.

## Summary

The device `dis-sw02` is a **Distribution Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunk ports connecting to both core and access switches. The switch is configured with a strong foundation of security features, including SSH, AAA, DHCP snooping, and access control lists. However, there are several areas for improvement, particularly in the areas of dynamic ARP inspection, port security, and NTP authentication. The configuration is well-structured and follows best practices for a distribution switch in a multi-VLAN environment.
