## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- Port security is enabled on 6 access ports, limiting unauthorized device access.  
- DHCP snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) are enabled on VLANs 10, 20, and 30, mitigating spoofing and ARP poisoning attacks.  
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential information leakage.  
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management VLAN, restricting access to trusted subnets.  
- Syslog is configured to send logs to a remote server, aiding in auditing and troubleshooting.  
- NTP is configured for time synchronization, which is essential for log correlation.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- AAA is not enabled, which means there is no centralized authentication, authorization, or accounting.  
- No 802.1X is configured, leaving wireless or wired access vulnerable to unauthorized device connections.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could help prevent IP spoofing.  
- SNMP is not configured, which limits monitoring and management capabilities.  
- No password is configured for the VTY lines, which could allow unauthorized access if SSH is compromised.  
- No banner is configured for VTY lines, which could be used to display legal disclaimers.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable AAA with local or RADIUS/TACACS+ authentication to enforce strong access control.  
- Implement 802.1X for wired and wireless ports to enforce device authentication.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs 10, 20, and 30 to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Configure SNMP with appropriate community strings and access controls for monitoring.  
- Set a password for the VTY lines to add an additional layer of security.  
- Add a banner to VTY lines to display legal disclaimers and deter unauthorized access.  
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting.

## Summary

This device, **switch-03**, is an **Access Layer** switch, as evidenced by the large number of access ports, port security configurations, and lack of routing. It is configured with VLANs for user segmentation and provides secure remote access via SSH. The switch has strong foundational security features such as DHCP snooping, DAI, and port security, but lacks advanced security controls like AAA and 802.1X. The configuration is generally well-structured and follows best practices for an access-layer switch, but there are several areas where security can be improved.
