- **AAA with TACACS+ integration** for authentication, authorization, and accounting ✓ VERIFIED
- **Port security** enabled on 8 access ports ✓ VERIFIED
- **DHCP snooping** and **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** enabled on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ✓ VERIFIED
- **CDP is disabled**, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED
- **Management access restricted** via ACL `MGMT-ACCESS` ✓ VERIFIED
- **NTP authentication** is enabled, ensuring time integrity ✓ VERIFIED
- **Syslog logging** is enabled with remote servers and source interface specified ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **802.1X** is not configured, leaving wireless or wired access vulnerable to unauthorized devices ? UNCERTAIN
- **IP Source Guard** is not enabled, which could help prevent IP spoofing ? UNCERTAIN
- **LLDP** is not enabled, which could be useful for network discovery and troubleshooting ? UNCERTAIN
- **No password complexity policy** is enforced for local users ? UNCERTAIN
- **No rate limiting** on SSH or console access ? UNCERTAIN
- **No secure SNMPv3** is used; current configuration uses SNMPv2c ? UNCERTAIN

#### Recommendations
- **Enable 802.1X** on access ports to enforce device authentication before network access.
- **Enable IP Source Guard** on VLANs with DHCP snooping to prevent IP spoofing.
- **Enable LLDP** for network discovery and troubleshooting.
- **Implement password complexity policies** for local users to enhance account security.
- **Consider rate limiting** on SSH and console access to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Upgrade SNMP to version 3** for stronger authentication and encryption.
- **Ensure all unused ports are shut down** and not left in default state.
- **Review and update ACLs** to ensure they are still aligned with current network policies.

## Summary

The device `aksess-sw10` is an **Access Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes a large number of access ports with port security, VLAN segmentation, and no routing enabled. The switch is configured with strong security features such as AAA with TACACS+, SSH-only VTY access, DHCP snooping, and Dynamic ARP Inspection. It is also integrated with syslog and NTP for monitoring and time synchronization. The configuration is well-structured and follows best practices for access layer security and management. ~ INFERRED
