## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication for console and VTY access.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, which helps prevent rogue DHCP servers.  
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing the risk of lateral discovery.  
- Management access is restricted using the `MGMT-ACCESS` ACL.  
- NTP is configured with a single server, ensuring time synchronization.  
- Syslog is configured to send logs to a remote server, aiding in auditing and troubleshooting.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **DHCP Snooping VLANs**: DHCP snooping is enabled globally but not restricted to specific VLANs. It is recommended to specify VLANs to limit scope and improve security.  
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**: Not enabled. DAI should be configured to prevent ARP spoofing attacks.  
- **Port Security**: Not enabled on any interfaces. Port security should be implemented on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.  
- **802.1X**: Not configured. If this switch connects to user devices, 802.1X should be enabled for secure authentication.  
- **IP Source Guard**: Not configured. IP Source Guard should be enabled in conjunction with DHCP snooping to prevent IP spoofing.  
- **LLDP**: Not enabled. LLDP could be used for network discovery and documentation.  
- **NTP Authentication**: NTP is configured without authentication. NTP authentication should be enabled to prevent time spoofing.  
- **SNMP**: Not configured. If SNMP is required, it should be configured with secure community strings and access controls.  

#### Recommendations
- **Enable DAI** on VLANs where DHCP snooping is active to prevent ARP spoofing.  
- **Enable IP Source Guard** on VLANs with DHCP snooping to prevent IP spoofing.  
- **Enable port security** on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.  
- **Enable 802.1X** if this switch connects to user devices.  
- **Specify VLANs for DHCP snooping** to limit scope and improve security.  
- **Enable NTP authentication** to secure time synchronization.  
- **Enable SNMP** with secure community strings and access controls if required.  
- **Enable LLDP** for network discovery and documentation.

## Summary

The device `dis-sw01` is a **Distribution Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is configured with secure remote access via SSH, AAA authentication, and access control via ACLs. The switch supports DHCP snooping and has a strong logging and NTP configuration. However, there are several security features missing, such as DAI, IP Source Guard, and port security, which should be implemented to improve the security posture.
