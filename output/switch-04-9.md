## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Device Role
- **Role**: ~ INFERRED  
  - This device is a **Distribution Layer** switch.  
  - Justification: It has multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs) with IP addresses, inter-VLAN routing is enabled, and it connects to both core and access switches.  

---

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication and authorization, providing a baseline for user access control.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, helping prevent rogue DHCP servers.  
- CDP is disabled, reducing the risk of network discovery attacks.  
- Access control lists (ACLs) are configured to restrict management access and block internal guest traffic.  
- Port security is not enabled, but this is expected for a distribution switch.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing.  
- **IP Source Guard** is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses to bypass ACLs.  
- **802.1X** is not configured, which could leave access ports vulnerable to unauthorized device access.  
- **SNMP** is not configured, which is a concern for monitoring and management.  
- **DHCP snooping** is enabled globally but not scoped to specific VLANs, which could reduce its effectiveness.  
- **VTP** is not configured, which is acceptable in a distribution switch but should be documented.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 50, and 99 to prevent ARP spoofing.  
- Enable **IP Source Guard** on VLANs where DHCP snooping is active to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Consider enabling **802.1X** on access ports if this switch connects to end-user devices.  
- Configure **SNMP** with secure community strings and access control to enable monitoring.  
- Scope **DHCP snooping** to specific VLANs (e.g., VLANs 10, 20, 30, 50, 99) to improve security.  
- Ensure **VTP** is either configured with secure passwords or disabled if not needed.

## Summary

dis-sw01 is a **Distribution Layer** switch running Cisco IOS 15.2(2)E9. It provides inter-VLAN routing, connects to core and access switches, and supports secure remote access via SSH. The configuration includes VLAN interfaces, routing, and basic security features such as AAA, DHCP snooping, and ACLs. The configuration is generally well-structured and secure, but additional security features like DAI and IP Source Guard should be implemented to further harden the device.
