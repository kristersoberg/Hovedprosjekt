## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Device Role
- **Device Role**: Access Layer Switch ~ INFERRED
  - Justification: High number of access ports, port security enabled, no routing enabled, and VLAN interfaces used for management only.

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only VTY access with version 2 and timeout ✓ VERIFIED
- AAA with TACACS+ authentication and accounting ✓ VERIFIED
- DHCP snooping and DAI enabled on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ✓ VERIFIED
- Port security configured on 8 access ports ✓ VERIFIED
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED
- Logging to two syslog servers with source interface specified ✓ VERIFIED
- NTP with authentication enabled ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- No 802.1X authentication configured, leaving wired access vulnerable to unauthorized devices ? UNCERTAIN
- No IP Source Guard configured, which could prevent IP spoofing ? UNCERTAIN
- No LLDP configured, which could be used for network discovery ? UNCERTAIN
- No SNMPv3 configured, leaving SNMP vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering ? UNCERTAIN
- No rate limiting or ACLs on the management VLAN beyond MGMT-ACCESS ? UNCERTAIN

#### Recommendations
- Enable 802.1X authentication on access ports to enforce device authentication.
- Implement IP Source Guard on VLANs with DHCP snooping to prevent IP spoofing.
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and monitoring.
- Upgrade SNMP to version 3 for secure communication.
- Add rate limiting and more granular ACLs to the management VLAN for enhanced security.
- Consider enabling NetFlow or IPFIX for traffic monitoring and analysis.

## Summary
The device `aksess-sw10` is an access layer switch serving multiple floors with VLANs for different departments and services. It is configured with strong security features such as AAA, SSH, DHCP snooping, and port security. The device is well-documented and follows best practices for access layer switches. However, there are opportunities to enhance security further by implementing 802.1X, IP Source Guard, and SNMPv3.
