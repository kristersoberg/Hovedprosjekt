## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a timeout of 60 seconds, which is a strong baseline for secure remote access.
- PortFast and BPDU Guard are enabled on access ports, reducing the risk of STP loops.
- A banner is configured for login sessions, which is a good legal and security practice.
- Syslog is enabled and configured to send logs to a remote server at 10.99.0.50.
- Password encryption is enabled via `service password-encryption`.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- AAA is not enabled, which means there is no centralized authentication, authorization, or accounting.
- No access control lists (ACLs) are applied to VTY lines, leaving SSH access potentially open to unauthorized users.
- DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, and IP Source Guard are not enabled, which increases the risk of Layer 2 attacks.
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.
- NTP is not configured, which may lead to time synchronization issues and affect log correlation.
- SNMP is not configured, which limits monitoring and management capabilities.
- VLAN 1 is active but shutdown, which is unnecessary and could be removed for clarity.

#### Recommendations
- Enable AAA for centralized authentication and authorization.
- Apply an ACL to the VTY lines to restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses.
- Enable DHCP Snooping on VLANs 10, 20, 50, and 99 to prevent rogue DHCP servers.
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on the same VLANs to prevent ARP spoofing.
- Enable IP Source Guard on access ports to prevent IP spoofing.
- Enable port security on access ports to limit the number of MAC addresses allowed per port.
- Configure NTP to ensure accurate time synchronization.
- Enable SNMP for monitoring and management.
- Remove VLAN 1 if it is not needed, or at least document its purpose clearly.
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting.

## Summary

This device, **switch-02**, is an **Access Layer** switch based on its configuration, which includes multiple access ports, VLAN tagging for voice traffic, and a trunk uplink to a distribution switch. It is not performing routing and has a management VLAN configured for remote access. The configuration is generally clean and includes some good security practices, but lacks several critical security features such as AAA, DHCP Snooping, and port security. The device is likely used to connect end-user devices and provide basic Layer 2 connectivity in a small to medium-sized network.
