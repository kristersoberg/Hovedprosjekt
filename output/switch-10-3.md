## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only access with version 2 and timeout of 60 seconds ✓ VERIFIED
- AAA authentication and authorization with TACACS+ and local fallback ✓ VERIFIED
- DHCP snooping and dynamic ARP inspection enabled on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ✓ VERIFIED
- Port security configured on 8 access ports ✓ VERIFIED
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED
- Management access is restricted via ACL `MGMT-ACCESS` ✓ VERIFIED
- NTP authentication is enabled, ensuring time integrity ✓ VERIFIED
- Logging is configured to two syslog servers with source interface Vlan99 ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- 802.1X is not configured, leaving wireless or wired access vulnerable to unauthorized devices ? UNCERTAIN
- IP Source Guard is not configured, which could help prevent IP spoofing ? UNCERTAIN
- SNMP community string is not visible in structured data, but it is configured with RO access and access control via ACL ✓ VERIFIED
- No explicit mention of password complexity or expiration policies ? UNCERTAIN
- No explicit mention of secure password storage beyond `service password-encryption` ✓ VERIFIED

#### Recommendations
- Implement 802.1X for secure port-based authentication ~ INFERRED
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs with DHCP snooping to prevent IP spoofing ~ INFERRED
- Enforce password complexity and expiration policies via AAA or local user configuration ~ INFERRED
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and monitoring ~ INFERRED
- Ensure all unused ports are physically secured and/or disabled ~ INFERRED

## Summary

This device, **aksess-sw10**, is an **Access Layer switch** ~ INFERRED, providing connectivity for end-user devices across multiple floors and departments. It is configured with port security, DHCP snooping, and dynamic ARP inspection to secure the access layer. Management access is restricted via ACL and SSH-only access. The switch is not routing traffic and is connected to a distribution switch via a trunk EtherChannel. The configuration is well-structured and includes strong security practices, but there are opportunities to enhance security further with additional features like 802.1X and IP Source Guard.
