## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- Port security is enabled on 6 access ports, limiting unauthorized device access.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANs 10, 20, and 30, preventing rogue DHCP servers.  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is enabled on the same VLANs, mitigating ARP spoofing.  
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential attack vectors.  
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management VLAN to restrict access to trusted subnets.  
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- AAA is not enabled, which limits centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting capabilities.  
- SNMP is not configured, which could be a missed opportunity for monitoring and management.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could help prevent IP spoofing.  
- 802.1X is not configured, which could enhance endpoint authentication.  
- No password is set for the `line con 0` console, leaving it vulnerable to local unauthorized access.  
- No password is set for the `line vty 0 4` VTY lines, which could be a risk if local access is possible.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable AAA with local or TACACS+/RADIUS authentication for centralized access control.  
- Implement SNMP with secure community strings and access control for monitoring.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs 10, 20, and 30 to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Consider enabling 802.1X for enhanced endpoint authentication.  
- Set passwords for `line con 0` and `line vty 0 4` to secure console and remote access.  
- Enable NTP authentication if the NTP server supports it, to prevent time spoofing.  
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting.  

## Summary

The device `switch-03` is an **Access Layer** switch, as evidenced by the large number of access ports, port security, and lack of routing. It serves as a local access point for end devices in VLANs 10 (Ansatte), 20 (Gjest), and 30 (Skrivere), with a management VLAN (99) for administrative access. The configuration includes several strong security features such as SSH, port security, DHCP snooping, and DAI. However, there are notable gaps in AAA, SNMP, and 802.1X, which could be improved to enhance security and management capabilities.
