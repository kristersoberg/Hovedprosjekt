## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, which is a good practice for secure remote access.
- PortFast and BPDU Guard are enabled on access ports, which helps prevent STP loops and unauthorized device connections.
- A banner is configured for login sessions, which is a good legal and security practice.
- Syslog is enabled with a remote server at 10.99.0.50, which is a good practice for centralized logging.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- AAA is not enabled, which means there is no centralized authentication, authorization, or accounting.
- No access control lists (ACLs) are applied to VTY lines, leaving SSH access potentially open to unauthorized users.
- DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, and IP Source Guard are not enabled, which leaves the network vulnerable to spoofing and rogue device attacks.
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.
- NTP is not configured, which could lead to time synchronization issues and affect log correlation.
- SNMP is not configured, which limits the ability to monitor and manage the device remotely.
- 802.1X is not configured, which means there is no port-based authentication for wired devices.

#### Recommendations
- Enable AAA with a RADIUS or TACACS+ server for centralized authentication and authorization.
- Apply an ACL to the VTY lines to restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses.
- Enable DHCP Snooping on VLANs 10, 20, 50, and 99 to prevent rogue DHCP servers.
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on the same VLANs to prevent ARP spoofing.
- Enable IP Source Guard on access ports to prevent IP spoofing.
- Enable port security on access ports to limit the number of MAC addresses allowed per port.
- Configure NTP with a trusted time source to ensure accurate timekeeping.
- Enable SNMP with appropriate community strings and access controls for remote monitoring.
- Consider enabling 802.1X for port-based authentication on access ports.
- Consider disabling CDP if it is not needed, as it can be used for reconnaissance.

## Summary

switch-02 is an **Access Layer** switch, as evidenced by the large number of access ports, the presence of PortFast and BPDU Guard, and the lack of routing functionality. It serves as a connection point for end-user devices and provides basic Layer 2 switching services. The configuration is generally clean and well-structured, but there are several security gaps that should be addressed to improve the overall security posture of the device.
