## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Device Role
- **Role**: ~ INFERRED  
  - This device is a **Distribution Layer** switch.  
  - Justification: It has multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs) with IP addresses, inter-VLAN routing enabled, and trunk ports connecting to both core and access switches. It also has HSRP configured for redundancy.  

---

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, preventing weak authentication methods.  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication and authorization, ensuring user access is controlled.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, reducing the risk of rogue DHCP servers.  
- CDP is disabled, reducing the risk of lateral discovery.  
- Access control lists (ACLs) are configured to restrict management access and internal guest traffic.  
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing.  
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses to bypass ACLs.  
- SNMP is not configured, which may limit monitoring and management capabilities.  
- VLAN 666 is used as the native VLAN on trunk ports, which is a security risk if untagged traffic is allowed.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally but not restricted to specific VLANs, which could allow untrusted VLANs to bypass snooping.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs where it is needed.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs with DHCP snooping to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Enable port security on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.  
- Consider configuring SNMP for monitoring and management.  
- Restrict DHCP snooping to specific VLANs to avoid untrusted VLANs bypassing the feature.  
- Change the native VLAN on trunk ports to a non-routed VLAN (e.g., VLAN 999) to prevent untagged traffic from being processed.  
- Consider enabling 802.1X authentication for wired access if the network supports it.

## Summary

dis-sw01 is a **Distribution Layer** switch running Cisco IOS 15.2(2)E9. It serves as an aggregation point between access switches and the core network, with multiple VLAN interfaces and inter-VLAN routing enabled. The device has strong security features such as SSH, AAA, and DHCP snooping, but lacks some advanced protections like DAI and IP Source Guard. The configuration is well-structured and includes redundancy via HSRP, but further hardening is recommended to improve security posture.
