## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.
- Port security is enabled on 4 access ports, limiting unauthorized device connections.
- 802.1X authentication is enabled, providing secure user and device authentication.
- DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, preventing rogue DHCP servers.
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, mitigating ARP spoofing attacks.
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential attack vectors.
- AAA is enabled with RADIUS authentication and local fallback, ensuring strong user authentication.
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to VTY lines, restricting management access to specific subnets.
- Syslog is enabled with a remote logging server, aiding in auditing and troubleshooting.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **NTP is not configured**, which could lead to time synchronization issues and affect log correlation.
- **LLDP is not enabled**, which could hinder network discovery and troubleshooting.
- **IP Source Guard is not configured**, which could leave the network vulnerable to IP spoofing.
- **SNMP is not configured**, which could limit network monitoring capabilities.
- **VLAN 1 is shutdown**, but it is still defined. Consider removing or re-purposing it.
- **VTP is not configured**, which is acceptable in a non-trunking or non-distributed environment, but should be documented.

#### Recommendations
- **Enable NTP** with at least one NTP server to ensure accurate time synchronization.
- **Enable LLDP** to improve network visibility and device discovery.
- **Enable IP Source Guard** on VLANs 10 and 20 to prevent IP spoofing.
- **Configure SNMP** with appropriate community strings and access controls for monitoring.
- **Remove or re-purpose VLAN 1** if it is not needed.
- **Consider enabling IP Source Guard** on VLANs 10 and 20 to enhance security.
- **Ensure all unused interfaces are properly documented and optionally shut down** to reduce attack surface.

## Summary

The device `switch-06` is an **Access Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes multiple access ports with port security, 802.1X authentication, and no routing enabled. It is configured with VLANs for user access, management, and isolation, and is connected to a distribution layer via trunk ports. The configuration is generally secure, with strong authentication, access control, and network security features enabled. However, there are opportunities to improve by enabling NTP, LLDP, and IP Source Guard, and by refining VLAN and SNMP configurations.
