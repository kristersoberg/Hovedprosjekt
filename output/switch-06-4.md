## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.
- AAA is enabled with RADIUS authentication for login and 802.1X, providing centralized authentication.
- DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, preventing rogue DHCP servers.
- Dynamic ARP Inspection is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, mitigating ARP spoofing.
- Port security is enabled on 4 access ports, limiting unauthorized device access.
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential attack surface.
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to VTY lines, restricting access to trusted subnets.
- A local emergency admin user is configured with privilege 15, ensuring access in case of RADIUS failure.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- NTP is not configured, which could lead to time synchronization issues and affect log correlation.
- LLDP is not enabled, which could hinder network discovery and troubleshooting.
- IP Source Guard is not configured, which could leave the network vulnerable to IP spoofing.
- SNMP is not configured, which may limit monitoring and management capabilities.
- No logging to internal buffer or file system is configured; logs are only sent to a remote server.
- No rate limiting or throttling is applied to SSH or console access.
- No password complexity policy is enforced for local users.
- No secure banner is configured for VTY lines (only a login banner is present).

#### Recommendations
- Enable and configure NTP with at least two servers for redundancy and authentication.
- Enable LLDP to improve network visibility and troubleshooting.
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs 10 and 20 to prevent IP spoofing.
- Configure SNMP with appropriate community strings and access control.
- Implement a password policy for local users to enforce complexity and expiration.
- Add a secure banner for VTY lines to warn unauthorized users.
- Consider enabling logging to internal buffer or file system for redundancy.
- Add rate limiting to SSH and console access to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Consider enabling port security on additional access ports for enhanced security.

## Summary

This device, **switch-06**, is an **Access Layer switch** based on its configuration. It features multiple access ports with 802.1X authentication, port security, and security features such as DHCP snooping and DAI. The switch is managed via VLAN 99 with an IP address of 10.99.1.6 and uses RADIUS for centralized authentication. The configuration is generally well-structured and secure, but there are opportunities to enhance security and monitoring capabilities.

~ INFERRED: Based on the presence of access ports, port security, and 802.1X, this is likely an access-layer switch in a secure enterprise network.

~ INFERRED: The use of RADIUS and 802.1X suggests a high-security environment with centralized authentication and authorization.

~ INFERRED: The presence of VLANs 10, 20, 99, 666, and 999 suggests a segmented network with roles for employees, guests, management, and quarantine.
