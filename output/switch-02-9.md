## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, providing secure remote access.
- PortFast and BPDU Guard are enabled on access ports, reducing STP-related vulnerabilities.
- A banner is configured for login sessions, warning unauthorized users.
- Syslog is enabled with a remote server at 10.99.0.50, aiding in monitoring and auditing.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- AAA is not enabled, which limits the ability to enforce strong authentication and authorization policies.
- No ACL is applied to VTY lines, leaving SSH access potentially open to unauthorized sources.
- DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection are not enabled, increasing the risk of spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Port security is not configured on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.
- NTP is not configured, which may impact time synchronization and log correlation.
- SNMP is not configured, limiting network monitoring capabilities.
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow IP spoofing on untrusted ports.

#### Recommendations
- Enable AAA with local authentication and, if possible, integrate with a RADIUS/TACACS+ server.
- Apply an ACL to VTY lines to restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses.
- Enable DHCP Snooping on VLANs 10, 20, 50, and 99 to prevent rogue DHCP servers.
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection on VLANs 10, 20, 50, and 99 to prevent ARP spoofing.
- Configure port security on access ports to limit the number of MAC addresses per port.
- Configure NTP with a trusted time source to ensure accurate timekeeping.
- Enable SNMP with appropriate community strings and access controls.
- Enable IP Source Guard on untrusted ports to prevent IP spoofing.

## Summary

switch-02 is an **Access Layer** switch, as evidenced by the large number of access ports and the absence of routing or aggregation features. It provides connectivity for user devices and a VoIP VLAN, with a trunk uplink to a distribution switch. The configuration is generally clean and includes some good security practices, but lacks several critical security features that should be implemented to harden the device.
