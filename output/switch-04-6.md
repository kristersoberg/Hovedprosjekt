## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- AAA is enabled with local authentication for console and VTY access.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, which helps prevent rogue DHCP servers.  
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing the risk of lateral discovery.  
- Access control lists (ACLs) are configured to restrict management access and block internal guest traffic.  
- HSRP is configured on all active VLAN interfaces, ensuring redundancy and high availability.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing attacks.  
- Port security is not configured on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses to bypass ACLs.  
- 802.1X is not configured, which could leave the network vulnerable to unauthorized device access.  
- VLAN 666 is used as the native VLAN on trunk ports, which is a security risk if it is not properly secured.  
- No VLAN-specific DHCP snooping is configured, which could allow rogue DHCP servers to operate in any VLAN.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on all VLANs to prevent ARP spoofing.  
- Implement port security on access ports to limit the number of MAC addresses allowed per port.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs where it is needed to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Consider implementing 802.1X authentication for wired and wireless access.  
- Change the native VLAN on trunk ports to a non-routed VLAN (e.g., VLAN 999) to reduce the risk of VLAN hopping.  
- Specify VLANs for DHCP snooping to ensure that only trusted VLANs are protected.  
- Consider enabling SNMP for monitoring and management, with secure community strings and access controls.

## Summary

The device `dis-sw01` is a **Distribution Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is configured with secure remote access via SSH, AAA authentication, and access control lists. The switch supports redundancy through HSRP and has basic security features like DHCP snooping and CDP disabled. However, additional security measures such as DAI, port security, and 802.1X should be implemented to strengthen the configuration.
