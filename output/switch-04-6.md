## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only VTY access with version 2 and 60-second timeout ✓ VERIFIED  
- Console access requires local authentication ✓ VERIFIED  
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally ✓ VERIFIED  
- CDP is explicitly disabled ✓ VERIFIED  
- VLAN interfaces (SVIs) have HSRP configured for redundancy ✓ VERIFIED  
- Access control lists (ACLs) are in place for management and guest traffic filtering ✓ VERIFIED  
- Logging is configured to a remote syslog server ✓ VERIFIED  
- NTP is configured for time synchronization ✓ VERIFIED  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- DHCP snooping is enabled but no specific VLANs are specified for snooping – this could leave some VLANs unprotected ? UNCERTAIN  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled – this could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing ? UNCERTAIN  
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces – this could allow unauthorized devices to connect ? UNCERTAIN  
- 802.1X is not configured – this could leave wired access vulnerable to unauthorized access ? UNCERTAIN  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled – this could allow spoofed IP addresses to be used ? UNCERTAIN  
- SNMP is not configured – this could limit monitoring capabilities ? UNCERTAIN  

#### Recommendations
- Specify VLANs for DHCP snooping to ensure all relevant VLANs are protected ~ INFERRED  
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs where it is needed ~ INFERRED  
- Consider enabling port security on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access ~ INFERRED  
- Implement 802.1X for wired access control ~ INFERRED  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs where it is needed ~ INFERRED  
- Configure SNMP for network monitoring and management ~ INFERRED  
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting ~ INFERRED

## Summary

The device `dis-sw01` is a **Distribution Layer switch** ~ INFERRED, based on the presence of multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is configured with a robust set of security features including SSH, ACLs, and DHCP snooping. However, there are several areas where additional security measures could be implemented, such as DAI, port security, and 802.1X. The configuration is generally well-structured and follows best practices for a distribution switch in a multi-VLAN environment.
