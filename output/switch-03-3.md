## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Device Role
- **Device Role**: ~ INFERRED  
  - This is an **Access Layer Switch**.  
  - Justification:  
    - High number of access ports (6) with port security enabled.  
    - No routing enabled (IP routing is disabled).  
    - Trunk ports exist but are limited to uplink interfaces.  
    - VLAN interfaces (SVIs) are minimal and only used for management.  

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a timeout of 60 seconds.  
- Port security is enabled on 6 access ports.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANs 10, 20, and 30.  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is enabled on the same VLANs.  
- CDP is explicitly disabled.  
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management VLAN to restrict access.  
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- AAA is not enabled, which is a best practice for secure authentication.  
- SNMP is not configured, which is necessary for monitoring and management.  
- 802.1X is not enabled, which could provide stronger endpoint authentication.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could help prevent IP spoofing.  
- No password is configured for the `line vty` or `line con 0` (console access is unauthenticated).  
- No password is configured for the `line aux 0`.  
- No password is configured for the `enable` command (only `enable secret` is set).  

#### Recommendations
- Enable AAA with local authentication and optionally integrate with a RADIUS/TACACS+ server.  
- Configure SNMP with a secure community string and enable SNMPv3 for better security.  
- Enable 802.1X authentication for wired access ports to enforce endpoint authentication.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs 10, 20, and 30 to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Set passwords for `line vty 0 4` and `line con 0` to enforce authentication for remote and console access.  
- Consider enabling SSH key-based authentication for administrative access.  
- Enable logging to a remote syslog server and configure log levels appropriately.  
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting.  

## Summary
switch-03 is an **Access Layer Switch** configured to provide network connectivity to end devices such as employee PCs, guest devices, and printers. It features strong security practices such as port security, DHCP snooping, and DAI, but lacks some advanced security features like AAA and 802.1X. The configuration is generally well-structured and follows best practices for access layer switches, but there are opportunities to enhance security and monitoring capabilities.
