## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, which is a strong baseline for secure remote access.
- PortFast and BPDU Guard are enabled on access ports, reducing the risk of STP loops and unauthorized device insertion.
- A banner is configured on login (`banner login ^CAdvarsel: Uautorisert tilgang er forbudt.^C`), which is a good legal and security practice.
- Syslog is enabled and configured to send logs to 10.99.0.50, which is a good practice for centralized logging.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- AAA is not enabled, which means there is no centralized authentication, authorization, or accounting. This is a significant gap in security.
- No access control lists (ACLs) are applied to VTY lines, leaving SSH access potentially open to unauthorized users.
- DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, and IP Source Guard are not enabled, which leaves the network vulnerable to spoofing and rogue device attacks.
- Port security is not enabled on any interface, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.
- NTP is not configured, which could lead to time synchronization issues and affect log correlation and certificate validation.
- SNMP is not configured, which may limit network monitoring and management capabilities.
- VLAN 1 is in use (via SVI) but is also shutdown, which is redundant and could be removed for clarity.

#### Recommendations
- Enable AAA with local or remote authentication (e.g., TACACS+ or RADIUS) to enforce strong access control.
- Apply an ACL to the VTY lines to restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses.
- Enable DHCP Snooping on VLANs 10, 20, 50, and 99 to prevent rogue DHCP servers.
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on the same VLANs to prevent ARP spoofing.
- Enable IP Source Guard on access ports to prevent IP spoofing.
- Enable port security on access ports to limit the number of MAC addresses allowed per port.
- Configure NTP with at least one reliable NTP server to ensure accurate timekeeping.
- Enable SNMP with appropriate community strings and access controls to allow network monitoring.
- Remove VLAN 1 SVI if it is not needed, or at least document its purpose clearly.
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting.

## Summary

switch-02 is an **Access Layer** switch, as evidenced by the large number of access ports, the presence of PortFast and BPDU Guard, and the absence of routing. It serves as a local access point for end-user devices and connects to a distribution switch via a trunk port.

The configuration is generally clean and includes some good security practices such as SSH and logging. However, there are several critical security gaps, including the lack of AAA, DHCP Snooping, and port security. These should be addressed to improve the security posture of the device.
