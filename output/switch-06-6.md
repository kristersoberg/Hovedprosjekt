## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Device Role
- **Role**: ~ INFERRED - **Access Layer Switch**
  - Justification: High number of access ports, port security enabled, 802.1X authentication, and no routing enabled.

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only VTY access with timeout and authentication ✓ VERIFIED
- Port security enabled on 4 access ports ✓ VERIFIED
- 802.1X authentication enabled for secure device access ✓ VERIFIED
- DHCP snooping and DAI enabled on VLANs 10 and 20 ✓ VERIFIED
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED
- AAA is enabled with RADIUS authentication and local fallback ✓ VERIFIED
- Management access is restricted via ACL 'MGMT-ACCESS' ✓ VERIFIED
- Logging is enabled to a remote syslog server ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- NTP is not configured, which could impact log and event timestamp accuracy ? UNCERTAIN
- SNMP is not configured, which may limit monitoring capabilities ? UNCERTAIN
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to IP spoofing ? UNCERTAIN
- LLDP is not enabled, which could limit network discovery and troubleshooting ? UNCERTAIN
- No VTP configuration is present, which may be intentional but should be documented ? UNCERTAIN
- VLAN 1 is shutdown, but it's still defined and could be a security risk if not properly managed ✓ VERIFIED

#### Recommendations
- Enable and configure NTP to ensure accurate time synchronization for logs and security events.
- Consider enabling SNMP for network monitoring and management.
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs 10 and 20 to prevent IP spoofing.
- Enable LLDP to improve network visibility and troubleshooting.
- Document the reason for not using VTP and ensure VLAN consistency across the network.
- Consider enabling port security on additional access ports for enhanced security.
- Ensure that VLAN 1 is not used for any production traffic and is properly secured.

## Summary

switch-06 is an **Access Layer Switch** configured with 802.1X authentication, port security, and security features such as DHCP snooping and DAI. It is managed via a dedicated management VLAN (VLAN 99) and uses RADIUS for AAA authentication. The device is well-secured with SSH-only access and logging to a remote syslog server. However, there are opportunities to improve by enabling NTP, SNMP, and IP Source Guard.
