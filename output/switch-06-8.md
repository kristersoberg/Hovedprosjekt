## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- Port security is enabled on 4 access ports, limiting unauthorized device connections.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, preventing rogue DHCP servers.  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, mitigating ARP spoofing.  
- 802.1X authentication is enabled, enforcing device and user authentication.  
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack vectors.  
- AAA is enabled with RADIUS integration, providing centralized authentication.  
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management interface, restricting access to trusted subnets.  
- Syslog is enabled with a remote server, ensuring auditability and monitoring.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- NTP is not configured, which could lead to time synchronization issues and affect log correlation.  
- SNMP is not configured, which may limit network monitoring capabilities.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses to bypass security controls.  
- LLDP is not enabled, which could hinder network discovery and troubleshooting.  
- VLAN 1 is shutdown, but it is still defined. Consider removing it if not needed.  
- No VLAN-specific STP root guard or BPDU guard beyond what is already configured.  
- No VLAN-specific QoS policies are defined, which could be important for traffic prioritization.  

#### Recommendations
- Configure NTP with at least one server to ensure accurate time synchronization.  
- Enable SNMP with appropriate community strings and access controls for monitoring.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs 10 and 20 to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting.  
- Remove VLAN 1 if it is not required, or explicitly disable it to avoid confusion.  
- Consider implementing VLAN-specific QoS policies to prioritize critical traffic.  
- Review and document the purpose of each VLAN and interface for clarity and future reference.  

## Summary

This device, **switch-06**, is an **Access Layer** switch, as evidenced by the large number of access ports, port security, and 802.1X authentication. It is not performing routing and is connected to a distribution layer via trunk links. The configuration is generally well-structured and includes several strong security features such as SSH, port security, DHCP snooping, and 802.1X. However, there are a few areas for improvement, particularly in time synchronization and monitoring capabilities. The configuration is stable and secure, but additional hardening and monitoring features could further enhance its resilience and manageability.
