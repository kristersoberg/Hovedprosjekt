### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only VTY access with version 2 and timeout of 60 seconds ✓ VERIFIED
- AAA authentication, authorization, and accounting with TACACS+ integration ✓ VERIFIED
- DHCP snooping and DAI enabled on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ✓ VERIFIED
- Port security configured on 8 access ports ✓ VERIFIED
- CDP is disabled to prevent unnecessary discovery ✓ VERIFIED
- Logging is enabled with remote syslog servers and source interface specified ✓ VERIFIED
- NTP is configured with authentication for time synchronization ✓ VERIFIED
- Access control is enforced via ACLs on VTY and SNMP access ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **802.1X** is not configured, which could enhance endpoint authentication on access ports ? UNCERTAIN
- **IP Source Guard** is not enabled, which could prevent IP spoofing on access ports ? UNCERTAIN
- **LLDP** is not enabled, which could be used for network discovery and monitoring ? UNCERTAIN
- **SNMP community string** is redacted, but it's unclear if it's a strong, unique string ? UNCERTAIN
- **Banner message** is configured, but it could be more specific to the device's role ? UNCERTAIN

#### Recommendations
- Enable **802.1X** on access ports to enforce endpoint authentication.
- Enable **IP Source Guard** on access ports to prevent IP spoofing.
- Consider enabling **LLDP** for network discovery and monitoring.
- Ensure **SNMP community strings** are strong and unique.
- Review and possibly enhance the **banner message** to include more specific device information.
- Consider enabling **portfast bpduguard** on all access ports to prevent STP loops.
- Ensure **TACACS+** servers are highly available and monitored for uptime.

## Summary

The device `aksess-sw10` is an **Access Layer switch** serving multiple floors with VLANs for different departments and services. It is configured with strong security features including AAA, SSH, DHCP snooping, DAI, and port security. The switch is managed via VLAN 99 with a dedicated management IP and remote syslog logging. The configuration is well-structured and follows best practices for access layer switches. The device is not routing and is connected to a distribution switch via an EtherChannel.

~ INFERRED: Based on the number of access ports, port security, and lack of routing, this is an access layer switch.
