## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only access with version 2 and timeout of 60 seconds ✓ VERIFIED
- AAA authentication, authorization, and accounting with TACACS+ integration ✓ VERIFIED
- DHCP snooping and dynamic ARP inspection enabled on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ✓ VERIFIED
- Port security configured on 8 access ports ✓ VERIFIED
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED
- Access control list (MGMT-ACCESS) restricts VTY access to internal networks ✓ VERIFIED
- NTP authentication is enabled ✓ VERIFIED
- Logging is configured with remote syslog servers and source interface specified ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- 802.1X is not configured, leaving wired access vulnerable to unauthorized device connections ? UNCERTAIN
- IP Source Guard is not configured, which could help prevent IP spoofing ? UNCERTAIN
- SNMP is configured with a read-only community string, but no write community is defined. Consider defining a write community with access control if needed ? UNCERTAIN
- No LLDP configuration is present, which could be useful for network discovery and troubleshooting ? UNCERTAIN
- No explicit rate limiting or QoS policies are defined for VoIP traffic (VLAN 50) ? UNCERTAIN

#### Recommendations
- Implement 802.1X authentication for wired access ports to enhance endpoint security ~ INFERRED
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs with DHCP snooping to prevent IP spoofing ~ INFERRED
- Consider enabling LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting ~ INFERRED
- Define a write SNMP community string with access control if remote configuration is required ~ INFERRED
- Review and possibly tighten the MGMT-ACCESS ACL to limit access to only necessary subnets ~ INFERRED
- Consider enabling NTP authentication keys for all NTP servers to ensure time synchronization integrity ~ INFERRED

## Summary

The device `aksess-sw10` is an **Access Layer switch** ~ INFERRED, providing connectivity to end-user devices across multiple floors and departments. It is configured with port security, DHCP snooping, and dynamic ARP inspection to secure the access layer. The switch is managed via VLAN 99 with SSH access and AAA authentication using TACACS+. It connects to a distribution switch via a Layer 2 EtherChannel and does not perform routing. The configuration is well-structured and includes strong security practices, but there are opportunities to enhance endpoint and network security further.
