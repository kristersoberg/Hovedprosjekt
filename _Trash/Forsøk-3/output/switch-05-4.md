## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access. ✓ VERIFIED
- AAA is enabled with local authentication for console and VTY access, providing basic user authentication. ✓ VERIFIED
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally, which helps prevent rogue DHCP servers. ✓ VERIFIED
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing the risk of network discovery attacks. ✓ VERIFIED
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to VTY lines to restrict remote access to trusted subnets. ✓ VERIFIED
- An extended ACL (`BLOCK-GUEST-INTERNAL`) is configured to block traffic from the guest VLAN to internal VLANs. ✓ VERIFIED
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users. ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- DHCP snooping is enabled globally but not limited to specific VLANs. It should be explicitly enabled on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 50, and 99 to ensure full protection. ? UNCERTAIN (not specified in data)
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing. ? UNCERTAIN
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect. ? UNCERTAIN
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses to be used on the network. ? UNCERTAIN
- 802.1X is not configured, which could leave the network vulnerable to unauthorized device access. ? UNCERTAIN
- No VLAN-specific ACLs are applied to SVIs beyond the Management VLAN. ? UNCERTAIN
- No VLAN-specific STP root guard or BPDU guard is configured. ? UNCERTAIN

#### Recommendations
- Enable DHCP snooping on specific VLANs (10, 20, 30, 50, 99) to ensure full protection.
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs where it is not already enabled.
- Enable port security on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs where it is not already enabled.
- Consider implementing 802.1X for secure device authentication.
- Apply VLAN-specific ACLs to SVIs to further restrict traffic.
- Consider enabling STP root guard or BPDU guard on uplink interfaces to prevent STP attacks.
- Enable NTP authentication to prevent time spoofing.
- Enable SNMP if needed, and configure it securely with read-only community strings and access restrictions.

## Summary

The device `dis-sw02` is a **Distribution Layer** switch, as it is configured with multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is running Cisco IOS version 15.2(2)E9 and is part of the domain `core.bedrift.no`. The configuration is generally well-structured and includes several security best practices, such as SSH access, AAA authentication, and ACLs. However, there are several areas where additional security features could be implemented to further harden the device.
