## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Device Role
- **Device Role**: ~ INFERRED - **Access Layer Switch**
  - Justification: The device has multiple access ports with port security, 802.1X authentication, and no routing enabled. It connects end-user devices and uplinks to a distribution switch.

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.
- 802.1X authentication is enabled on access ports, providing strong user and device authentication.
- DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, preventing rogue DHCP servers.
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is enabled on VLANs 10 and 20, mitigating ARP spoofing attacks.
- Port security is enabled on 4 access ports, limiting the number of MAC addresses per port.
- CDP is disabled, reducing the risk of lateral discovery.
- AAA is enabled with RADIUS authentication and local fallback, ensuring centralized authentication.
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management interface, restricting access to trusted subnets.
- Syslog is enabled with a remote logging server, ensuring auditability and monitoring.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- NTP is not configured, which could lead to time synchronization issues and affect log correlation.
- SNMP is not configured, which may limit network monitoring capabilities.
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to IP spoofing.
- LLDP is not enabled, which could limit visibility into connected devices.
- No VLAN 1 is used, but it is still active as an SVI. It should be shut down to prevent unnecessary exposure.
- No VLAN 666 or 999 SVIs are configured, but they are referenced in trunk ports. Consider creating SVIs if needed for management or monitoring.

#### Recommendations
- Enable NTP with at least one NTP server to ensure accurate time synchronization.
- Consider enabling SNMP with appropriate community strings and access controls for monitoring.
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs 10 and 20 to prevent IP spoofing.
- Enable LLDP to improve visibility into connected devices.
- Ensure VLAN 1 is fully shut down and not used for any traffic.
- Consider enabling VLAN 666 and 999 SVIs if they are used for specific purposes (e.g., monitoring, quarantine).
- Review and tighten the `MGMT-ACCESS` ACL to ensure it only allows necessary subnets.
- Ensure all RADIUS server keys are securely stored and periodically rotated.

## Summary
The device `switch-06` is an access layer switch configured with 802.1X authentication, port security, and security features such as DHCP snooping and DAI. It connects end-user devices and uplinks to a distribution switch. The configuration is generally secure and well-structured, with a few areas for improvement, particularly in time synchronization and monitoring capabilities. The device is managed via a dedicated management VLAN and uses RADIUS for centralized authentication.
