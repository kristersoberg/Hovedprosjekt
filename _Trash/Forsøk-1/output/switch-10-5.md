## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH-only access with version 2 and 60-second timeout ✓ VERIFIED
- AAA authentication and authorization with TACACS+ and local fallback ✓ VERIFIED
- DHCP snooping and DAI enabled on VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ✓ VERIFIED
- Port security configured on 8 access ports ✓ VERIFIED
- CDP is disabled, reducing potential attack surface ✓ VERIFIED
- Logging is enabled with remote syslog servers and source interface specified ✓ VERIFIED
- NTP is configured with authentication, ensuring accurate time synchronization ✓ VERIFIED
- Access control is enforced via ACLs on VTY and SNMP access ✓ VERIFIED

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- **802.1X** is not configured, which could enhance endpoint authentication for wired devices ? UNCERTAIN
- **IP Source Guard** is not enabled, which could provide additional protection against IP spoofing ? UNCERTAIN
- **LLDP** is not enabled, which could be useful for network discovery and troubleshooting ? UNCERTAIN
- **SNMP community string** is redacted, but it's unclear if it's a strong, non-default value ? UNCERTAIN
- **Banner message** is configured, but it could be more detailed or include legal disclaimers ? UNCERTAIN

#### Recommendations
- Enable **802.1X** for enhanced endpoint authentication, especially in high-security environments.
- Consider enabling **IP Source Guard** on VLANs with DHCP snooping to prevent IP spoofing.
- Enable **LLDP** for network discovery and troubleshooting, if not already in use.
- Review and strengthen **SNMP community strings** to ensure they are not default or easily guessable.
- Consider implementing **rate limiting** on the management interface to prevent brute-force SSH attacks.
- Ensure **TACACS+** servers are highly available and monitored for outages.
- Consider enabling **NTP authentication keys** with stronger algorithms if available in the IOS version.
