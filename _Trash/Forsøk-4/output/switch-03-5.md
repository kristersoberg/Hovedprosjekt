## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is configured with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.  
- Port security is enabled on 6 access ports, limiting unauthorized device access.  
- DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANs 10, 20, and 30, preventing rogue DHCP servers.  
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is enabled on the same VLANs, mitigating ARP spoofing.  
- CDP is explicitly disabled, reducing potential attack vectors.  
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management VLAN to restrict access.  
- NTP is configured for time synchronization, which is essential for log correlation.  
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.  

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- AAA is not enabled, which means there is no centralized authentication, authorization, or accounting.  
- 802.1X is not configured, which could improve endpoint authentication.  
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could help prevent IP spoofing.  
- SNMP is not configured, which limits monitoring and management capabilities.  
- LLDP is not enabled, which could be useful for network discovery and troubleshooting.  
- No password is configured for the VTY lines, which could allow unauthorized access if SSH is compromised.  
- No password is configured for the console line, which could allow physical access to be exploited.  

#### Recommendations
- Enable AAA for centralized authentication and authorization.  
- Implement 802.1X for secure endpoint authentication.  
- Enable IP Source Guard on VLANs 10, 20, and 30 to prevent IP spoofing.  
- Configure SNMP for monitoring and management.  
- Enable LLDP for network discovery and troubleshooting.  
- Set passwords for the VTY and console lines to enforce authentication.  
- Consider enabling SSH authentication using AAA for stronger access control.  
- Review and tighten the `MGMT-ACCESS` ACL to ensure it only allows necessary IP ranges.  

## Summary

switch-03 is an **Access Layer** switch, as evidenced by the high number of access ports, port security configurations, and lack of routing. It serves as a local access point for end devices in VLANs 10 (Ansatte), 20 (Gjest), and 30 (Skrivere), with a dedicated management VLAN (99). The configuration includes several good security practices such as SSH, port security, DHCP snooping, and DAI, but lacks some advanced security features like 802.1X and AAA. The configuration is generally well-structured and follows best practices for an access-layer switch.  

**Device Role**: Access Layer Switch ~ INFERRED
