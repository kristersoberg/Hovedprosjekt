## Configuration Quality Assessment

### Security Posture

#### ✓ Strengths
- SSH is enabled with version 2 and a 60-second timeout, ensuring secure remote access.
- AAA is enabled with local authentication and authorization, providing a baseline for access control.
- DHCP snooping is enabled, helping to prevent rogue DHCP servers.
- CDP is disabled, reducing the risk of network discovery attacks.
- A standard ACL (`MGMT-ACCESS`) is applied to the management VLAN to restrict access.
- An extended ACL (`BLOCK-GUEST-INTERNAL`) is configured to block internal traffic from the guest VLAN to other VLANs.
- A banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.

#### ⚠ Areas for Improvement
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is not enabled, which could leave the network vulnerable to ARP spoofing.
- Port security is not enabled on any interfaces, which could allow unauthorized devices to connect.
- 802.1X is not configured, which could leave the network open to unauthorized access.
- IP Source Guard is not enabled, which could allow spoofed IP addresses to be used.
- VLAN 1 is active but has no IP address and is shutdown, which is unnecessary and could be removed.
- VLAN 666 is referenced in trunk configurations but has no configuration in the VLAN database, which could be a misconfiguration or oversight.
- No SNMP is configured, which limits monitoring and management capabilities.

#### Recommendations
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on VLANs where it is needed.
- Enable port security on access ports to prevent unauthorized device access.
- Implement 802.1X authentication for secure user and device access.
- Enable IP Source Guard to prevent IP address spoofing.
- Remove VLAN 1 configuration if it is not needed.
- Investigate and configure VLAN 666 if it is intended to be used.
- Consider enabling SNMP for monitoring and management.
- Ensure all VLANs have appropriate security features enabled based on their purpose.

## Summary

The device `dis-sw02` is a **Distribution Layer switch** based on its configuration, which includes multiple VLAN interfaces (SVIs), inter-VLAN routing, and trunking to both core and access switches. It is running Cisco IOS version 15.2(2)E9 and is part of the domain `core.bedrift.no`. The configuration is generally well-structured and includes several security best practices, such as SSH access, AAA, and DHCP snooping. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in terms of additional security features like DAI, port security, and 802.1X.
